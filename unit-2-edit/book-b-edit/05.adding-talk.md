We have called the talk 'create' in the above. Examine the markdown file:

~~~markdown
Lecture 2

Provide a short summary, perhaps supported by a representative image.

Change to a suitable text:

~~~markdown
Create!

Go Create some new resources
~~~

Lets try to use a different image - here is an example:

![png](img/x20.png)

Download and place this image into the talk-3-create folder, calling it 'create.png'.

Republish the course to see the new resource:
