### JSON

This folder is automatically generated when the command `npx tutors-json` is run from the tutors-starter directory. The contents of this file are used by Netlify to build and deploy your Tutors site. This will be elaborated on in later steps.

**Note**: If you are experimenting with the file structure and the `npx tutors-json` command is not applying changes correctly, just delete this folder and run the command again!
